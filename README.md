**The purpose of this project** is to create a pacemaker device using a custom developed PCB. <br>
The project is split into two sections: Device Control Monitor (DCM) and Simulink teams. <br>
The DCM team creates a functional UI that is capable of controlling the pacemarker by Serial Communication to the Pacemarker board.<br>
The Simulink team creates a model of the packmakers that is capable of taking inputs from the DCM and adpats the pacemaker behaviour accordingly. <br>
<br>
Supported pace modes include: AOO, VOO, AAI, VVI, AOOR, VOOR, AAIR, VVIR. <br>
Rate adaptive pacing is enabled to support AAIR and VVIR modes. <br>
Serial Communication is setup between Simulink and DCM to establish mannual control<br>
